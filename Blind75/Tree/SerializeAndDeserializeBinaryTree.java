/**
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file
 * or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
 * <p>
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization
 * algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized
 * to the original tree structure.
 * <p>
 *  Binary Tree Example: <br>
 *              1 <br>
 *            /  \ <br>
 *          2     3 <br>
 *               / \ <br>
 *              4   5
 * <p>
 * In serialization, you will be given a binary tree like above and you have to convert it to a string.<br>
 * For above binary tree the string while serializing would be [1,2,3,#,#,4,5,#,#,#,#] <br>
 * Here, # means the root node doesn't have a left or right sub-tree
 * <p>
 * Similarly, while deserializing the string [1,2,3,#,#,4,5,#,#,#,#] should be converted to binary tree like above

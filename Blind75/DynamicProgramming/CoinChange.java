/**
 * You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
 * <p>
 * Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
 * <p>
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <br>
 * Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11 <br>
 * Output: 3 <br>
 * Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <br>
 * Input: coins = [2], amount = 3 <br>
 * Output: -1 <br>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <br>
 * Input: coins = [1], amount = 0 <br>
 * Output: 0

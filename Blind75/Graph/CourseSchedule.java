/**
 * There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. <br>
 * You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that <br>
 * you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai. <br>
 * <p>
 * For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1. <br>
 * Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false. <br>
 * <p>
 * <b>Example 1:</b>
 * <p>
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]] <br>
 * Output: true <br>
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. <br>
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible. <br>
 * <p>
 * <b>Example 2:</b>
 * <p>
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]] <br>
 * Output: false <br>
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. <br>
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 <br>
 * you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible. <br>
 *
 * <p><b>graph:</b></p>
 * Represents a directed graph where each course points to the courses that depend on it.
 *
 * <p>The graph is implemented as an array of ArrayLists. Each index in the array corresponds
 * to a course, and the list at graph[i] contains all the courses that have course 'i' as a prerequisite.
 * This helps in visualizing course dependencies and managing course ordering.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>degree:</b></p>
 * Stores the number of prerequisites (incoming edges) for each course.
 *
 * <p>The degree array helps track how many prerequisites a course has. A course with an
 * indegree of 0 means that it has no dependencies and can be taken immediately. This array is
 * updated dynamically as courses are processed.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>queue:</b></p>
 * A queue used to perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the course dependency graph.
 *
 * <p>The queue initially contains all courses with no prerequisites (indegree 0).
 * As we process courses, we remove them from the queue, reduce the indegree of dependent courses,
 * and add newly eligible courses (with indegree 0) to the queue.</p>
